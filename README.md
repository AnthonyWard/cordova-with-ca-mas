# Plugin to auto download SDK via Pods or Gradle

This is a test project for plugin: https://github.com/AnthonyWard/cordova-plugin-mas-automation

> You will need to add an `android_msso_config.json` and `ios_msso_config.json` in the www folder.

## Notes

> Delete `plugins`, `platforms`, `node_modules` and `package.json` if Cordova gets itself in a confused state while building
